Since he was a child, he witnessed his parents spend a lot of time for the management of all the facets of the mini-market, using paper supports and agendas. He used to do so himself, but now he wants a change of pace in the management department.  He wants to increase productivity and reduce working hours spent at repeating the same tasks with his desk-calculator, so that he can spend more time with his family and friends.  John is not familiar with computer management systems, but is an active social network and eBay worker: he would like a management program which resembles the structure of websites and services he already knows. ### Cashier Maurice is 30 and works as a cashier. He is the worker with the closest relationship to the consumer: for this reason he uses a POS to manage people's purchases and, sometimes, to refund unsatisfied customers. He needs an easy-to-use tool to save every type of transaction that takes place, whether as a sale or as a refund. ### Warehouse worker Ashlen, 23, warehouse worker of the mini-market, is a student-worker.  She works part-time in the market, in order to pay university taxes by herself.  She is a very precise person and likes to keep her workplace well organized and she is always on a tight schedule. She already used an Excel sheet to keep track of the market's inventory: she would like a better-looking and easier to use software to help her in keeping the inventory organized. ### Accountant Mark is 45 years old and has been working as an accountant at EzShop for 15 years. He manages the financial aspects and supports the order management of the shop. He always complains about the paperwork and would like technological support to help him keep track of the shop's performance, including information about orders placed, tax receipts and expenditures, so that he can identify problems immediately and act promptly to resolve them. # Functional and non functional requirements ## Functional Requirements | ID | Description | | ------------- |:-------------:| | FR1 | Manage workers | | -1.1 | Create a new worker | | -1.2 | Modify an existing worker | | -1.3 | Delete a worker | | -1.4 | Show all the workers | | -1.5 | Show personal page | | FR2 | Manage sales | | -2.1 | Process receipt from POS System | | -2.2 | Update inventory | | -2.3 | Update statistics | | --2.3.1 | Update counters for each sale | | --2.3.2 | Update customer statistic | | -2.4 | Show sales history | | -2.5 | Cancel sale | | FR3 | Manage inventory | | -3.1 | Add a new product to all product list | | -3.2 | Remove a product from product list | | -3.3 | Modify an existent product | | --3.3.1 | Modify quantity of a product | | --3.3.2 | Modify name | | --3.3.3 | Modify description | | --3.3.4 | Modify supplier list | | --3.3.5 | Modify price | | --3.3.6 | Modify discount | | -3.4 | List inventory products | | --3.4.1 | List products by filters | | FR4 | Manage accounting | | -4.1 | Manage order | | --4.1.1 | Add a new order | | --4.1.2 | Modify order | | --4.1.3 | Remove order | | -4.2 | List orders | | --4.2.1 | List orders by filters | | -4.3 | List incomes-exits | | --4.3.1 | List by filters | | -4.4 | Show sales statistics | | FR5 | Manage suppliers | | -5.1 | Add supplier | | -5.2 | Modify supplier | | --5.2.1 | Modify contact info | | -5.3 | Remove supplier | | FR6 | Manage customers | | -6.1 | Add a new customer | | -6.2 | Modify an existent customer | | --6.2.1 | Modify contact info | | --6.2.2 | Update fidelity points | | -6.3 | Remove a customer | ## Access rights | Function | Manager | Cashier | Accountant | Warehouse worker | | :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :--------: | :--------------: | | FR1 | Yes | No | No | No | | FR2 | Yes | Yes | No | No | | FR3 | Yes | No | No | Yes | | FR4 | Yes | No | Yes | No | | FR5 | Yes | No | No | No | | FR6 | Yes | Yes | No | No | ## Non Functional Requirements | ID | Type | Description | Refers to FR | | ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:| | NFR1 | Accuracy | The software must have floating point precision in the order of 10<sup>-4</sup> | All FR | | NFR2 | Security | The shop data can be accessed only by allowed workers | -
